    <li>
        Samantha Hess started her business in Portland Oregon in 2013
    </li>

    <li>
        She started it after divorcing her husband because she couldn’t continue living in a touch desert
    </li>

    <li>
        She started her business after reading about a man charging $2 for deluxe hugs
    </li>

    <li>
        She thought that if someone went up to her and offered her a free cookie, she’d be concerned, but if she was offered a cookie for money, she’d know what their ulterior motives are
    </li>

    <li>
        She put up fliers around town and made a website. She was fully booked for the first 2 months
    </li>

    <li>
        Communication was problematic:
        <li>
            3 people asked for marriage
            1 person asked her to join a harem
            She received plenty of inappropriate emails
        </li>
    </li>

    <li>
        All potential clients must fill out a 3 page form and go through a consultation before they are approved
    </li>

    <li>
        All touch must be consensual. Bathing suit areas are off limits
    </li>

    <li>
        Sessions are videotaped to enforce rules
    </li>

    <li>
        When people are aroused, they take a few minute break to reposition themselves
    </li>

    <li>
        Cuddlers can choose between 70 different cuddling positions, ranging from “mama bear” to “gummy worm”
