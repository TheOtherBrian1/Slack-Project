- Graduate thesis

- Methodology for obtaining data:

- Sampling data from

- 76 females

- 44 males

- Measures used for determining loneliness and obtaining data

- Demographic questionnaire

- Bem Sex Role Inventory

- Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale

- Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale

- Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults - SF

- Definition of loneliness:

- Although the definition of loneliness is variable, most accepted definitions share three characteristics

- Results from a deficiency in social relationships

- loneliness is subjective

- the experience is negative

- Loneliness is linked to:

- depression

- suicide

- suicide ideation

- anxiety

- substance abuse

- There are two models for defining loneliness:

- Unidimensional model: loneliness is a singular, invariable emotion, that only changes in intensity

- This model has guided most research

- Most research in loneliness has shown a favoritism towards the unidimensional UCLA Scale for measuring loneliness

- Multidimensional model: loneliness can be defined as a class of emotions that may contain between 2 and 12 subtypes. Principal components analysis has provided empirical evidence for the theories validity. It does not invalidate the other's theory

- One of the most famous variations of multidimensional loneliness comes from a 1973 research paper by a guy named Weiss. He emphasizes two categories of loneliness

- Those caused by emotional isolation

- absence of close, intimate, emotional attachment

- Example: you have no intimate friends or partners, but you can go to pub and party or hang out with the board game nerds

- Those caused by social isolation

- absence of a social network or community

- You have a partner and a few close friends, but you can't go to Shul, or party, or hang out at the bar

- The main difference between the two is that the UCLA loneliness scale focused only on subjective lack of connection and failed to recognize other kinds of loneliness, specifically pathological types.

- are men lonelier than women?

- It depends on the study you use. The author sites 2 studies that suggest there is no significant gender difference

- But other studies have shown that men are lonelier

- Resolution might have been found through a study by Borys and Perlman in 1985

- When loneliness was measured through self-labeling, for instance, asking someone (if they are lonely) often shows that women are lonelier

- However, when measurements were made using the UCLA loneliness scale, males were lonelier

- Lau and Gruen (1992) suggested that men may refrain from authentic vulnerability, consciously or unconsciously because the social consequences of vulnerability may be more severe for men"

- a meta study in 2006 of 31 studies using the unidimensional definition found that in 19 studies, loneliness was not predictable by gender

- 9 studies showed that boys were significantly lonelier than girls

- 2 studies found that girls were lonelier than boys

- 1 study did not report gender differences

- One explanation for this is that men are socialized in social-emotional areas and they handle loneliness in counterproductive ways that impose further alienation. The study linked below this one suggests that male loneliness coping mechanisms exacerbate alienation

- Few studies have analyzed loneliness using the multidimensional approach:

- When using a revised UCLA Loneliness Scale that takes two dimensions into accounts. Using this scale, studies have found that men score higher on global, social, and emotional loneliness than females had

- One scale that measures multidimensional loneliness, the Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults was used in a 1993 study found no difference in men and women for family emotional loneliness, but that found men were lonelier than females on social loneliness and romantic emotional loneliness.

- Because there are inconsistent results between gender and loneliness, an alternative and perhaps more fruitful indicator for loneliness can be predicted through gender roles.

- Perhaps gender traits plays a greater role in loneliness. Women who exhibit excessively masculine traits may be lonelier than men who exhibit the same.

- According to a 1981 study, assertiveness and dominance are often viewed as masculine traits, but emotionality and understanding are viewed as feminine

- He devised a survey, the Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI), that measured three sub scales of masculinty, femininity, and social desirability

- Usually, masculinity and femininity are seen as two polar ends on a continuum; however, in 1974 a researcher posited that these traits may exist independently and can be displayed on two orthogonal axes.

- Androgenous individuals were those who scored high in both masculine and feminine traits

- Undifferentiated had low scores in both femininity and masculinity

- Bem suggested that Androgenous people have the greatest capacity for flexibility and adaptability, so they are resistant to social curses that come from deprivation

- According to future studies that utilized BSRI

- Undifferentiated were the loneliest

- Androgenous people were the least

- Many studies have found that women benefit from androgeny, but it had no effect on men

- Self-esteem and loneliness

- Low self-esteem is significantly correlated with loneliness. Self-esteem is a good predictor of global, social, and emotional loneliness

- High levels of masculinity is associated with high levels of self-esteem, so if someone is low in masculinity, it doesn't mean they are lonely, but that is a proxy for something that might indicate loneliness, self-esteem.

- A meta study found that the difference between male and female self-esteem is negligible and unlikely to explain discrepancies between loneliness

- The study:

- 120 students from Brandeis, 76 female, 44 male, 75% white, 16.7% asian, median age was 19.34, none were married

- Surveys: steps were taken to prevent the social desriability effect from affecting people's responses

- Demographic survey: gain general info, like age, ethnicity, marital status, etc

- BSRI test: measured each person's femininity and masculinity

- Self-esteem scale by SES; rosenberg: to track self-esteem

- Revised UCLA Loneliness Sclae: to test global loneliness

- Social and Emotional Loneliness Scale for Adults:

- tested:

- social loneliness

- emotional loneliness

- subtypes of emotional loneliness

- romantic

- family

- Useful results from the study:

- Men were lonelier than females according to global loneliness scores

- emotional and social loneliness showed no connection to gender

- Although men are more likely to experience loneliness, they are less likely to confess

- This suggests that men are socialized in a way that encourages maladaptive coping mechanisms or they are penalized more severely for vulnerability

- It seems that masculinity in women alleviated social and global loneliness in women, but had no impact in me

- femininity was not a predictor for neither men nor women

- Androgenous individuals are significantly less lonely than undifferentiated and were 'probably' less globally lonely than femine and masculine individuals.

- This supports the claim that adaptability is essential for staving off loneliness

- Self-esteem was correlated with reduced loneliness for both men and women, though it was correlated with masculinity

- Women who exhibited high levels of masculinity also exhibited high levels of self-esteem and were less lonely

- It should be noted that the BSRI is a bit dated and uses only positive stereotypes. If it included negative stereotypes, then it might be better at finding patterns of self-destruction that lead to loneliness

- The study warns that there are likely better predictors for evaluating loneliness: deficient social skills, negative attitudes, depression, shyness, and cynicisms
