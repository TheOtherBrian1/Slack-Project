- An anonymous survey of 377 freshman and sophomore students at East Carolina University found that

- (57% respondents were women)

- (43% respondents were men)

- ages ranged from 17 to 39, but the median age was 18

- 85.9% of respondents were white

- 14.1% were black

- 25.9% of men felt a deep sense of loneliness

- 16.7% of women felt a deep sense of loneliness

- It was noted that parental divorce, on campus living or off, and fraternity/sorority living had no notable impact on loneliness

- men were less likely to be in a love relationship

- men were less likely to know how to make friends

- more likely to drink alcohol

- more likely to consider themselves losers

- The work suggests that Social Script theory may be able to explain these outcomes

- Perhaps men aren't socialized to value friendship or aren't taught how to initiate, nurture, and maintain close relationships.

- Most research on loneliness has focused on adolescents and the elderly. This study prioritized an often neglected group, young adults

- Loneliness is correlated with:

- social isolation

- low self-esteem

- age (older adolescents experience it more than younger ones)

- depression

- relocation

- Loneliness often affects physical health as well:

- Likely impetus for relapse in anorexia and bulimia nervosa patients

- less sleep

- mortality

- Numerical data:

- Relationships:

- 53.8% of women reported involvement in an emotional relationship

- 36.1% for men

- Men were 4 times more likely to say that they "do not know how to go about making friends"

- 9.3% of men, but only 2.3% of women agreed that they don't know how to make friends

- Self-conceptualization

- Men were 4.77 times more likely to identify as a loser

- 8.6% of men identified

- 1.8% of women identified
