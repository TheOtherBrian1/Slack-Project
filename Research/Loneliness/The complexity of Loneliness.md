The complexity of loneliness (nih.gov)
Physical disorders linked to loneliness:
heart disease
lung disease
cardiovascular disease
hypertension
atherosclerosis
stroke
metabolic disorders, such as obesity and metabolic disease
morbidity and mortality in adults
Psychological disorders predicted by loneliness
depression
psychological stress
anxiety
Loneliness is a multidimensional and complex construct
the percentage of elderly people living by themselves are going up
Isolation and loneliness are exclusive from each other (“a person can be alone and not feel alone”)
Weiss, an expert in loneliness, asserts that loneliness is a natural phenomenon that affects people from all age groups, backgrounds, and genders
Culturally, “loneliness is often seen as rooted in weakness or self-pity, as something that - supposedly - the individual should be able to eliminate, since it is not a physical ailment”
Loneliness can be defined multidimensionally.
Social loneliness: “lack of a social network, the absence of a circle of people that allows an individual to develop a sense of belonging, of company, of being part of a community.”
emotional loneliness: “absence of an attachment figure (together with the feelings of isolation)
loneliness can be defined as a social pain similar to physical pain. Pain manifests to protect us from physical danger, so social pain exists to protect us from social dangers. Loneliness exists to protect us from the social danger and encourage strong social bonds
The problems with loneliness and social isolation:
risk of social frailty
limited social support resources
poverty
social exclusion
physical frailty
mortality
How is loneliness evaluated:
Some researchers rely on a single question from the CES-D: “are you lonely” or “do you feel lonely”, or “do you suffer from loneliness”
Some of used scales to measure intensity
The UCLA Loneliness Scale and the Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale (dJGLS). Although both measure multidimensional loneliness, the UCLA one have been modified for both
The dJGLS is used often in Europe
The concluding sentence of the section is truly beautiful:
“However you look at it, loneliness, that sense of lacking or privation, exerts a powerful influence over our health. There are multiple facets to loneliness: there are feelings of emptiness or abandonment associated with a lack of relationships or intimacy; there is the temporal perspective, (loneliness sets in over time) through which the individual perceives his or her own loneliness; there is the set of emotional aspects that accompany loneliness, including sadness, melancholy, frustration, shame or desperation; and, there is the individual’s own subjective evaluation regarding the quality and quantity of his or her social relationships, built and rebuilt by the people in their lives, an evaluation which depends on the continuous interaction between factors which are rather diverse (identity, personality, expectations, life events, interpersonal engagement, socio-economic variables, household, etc.). Yet, despite all of this, while effective interventions are necessary, they are still scarce.”
Loneliness and Health:
Health determinants linked with mortality are divided into two categories
Intrinsic: genetics, frailty, medical conditions
extrinsic: environment, physical conditions, social detriments (NO FRIENDS, no family, bad spouse), socioeconomic detriments (poverty, education, abuse)
social vulnerability is measured by the amount of social determinants in your life and is linked with hospital mortality and frailty
Health and development are defined by our capacity to involve ourselves in our communities, engage in social activities, live independently, and control the circumstances of our lives. The factors are grouped under social vulnerability
social vulnerability:
a list of social deficits that can be counted and quantified. high social vulnerability leads to high levels of frailty
Social vulnerability affects people at the cellular level. It’s an aggravating factor for
cognitive deterioration
Alzheimer’s disease
stroke
hypertension
These disorders are facilitated by social vulnerabilities affect on our
vascular resistance
changes to the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis
immune changes
increase in inflammatory activity
increase leukocyte and lymphocyte activity
the affects of social factors on our health has not been studied as much as clinical or biological factors
Although physical frailty is of great importance, there are researchers suggesting we should expand the definition of frailty syndrome to include psychosocial factors. Essentially, there would be a multidimensional definition of frailty that would include social vulnerability/frailty as a factor
Unfortunately, social frailty has not been well explored
Social vulnerability is comprised of three factors:
affection
behavioral confirmation
status
low scores in these factors lead to reduced life satisfaction
Vulnerability, frailty, and poverty are all linked with high rates of geriatric syndromes and mortality in the elderly. Loneliness is a factor
A possible explanation for the link between loneliness, and geriatric disorders are:
frail and isolated individuals have increased activity of interleukin 6, C-reactive protein, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which can be exacerbating factors
Poor social environment significantly impacts immunity
poor social integration impacts neuroendocrine activity
positive emotions attenuate negative effects of perceived loneliness
The following are aggravating factors for independence loss
social isolation
inadequate living conditions
poverty
bad environment
Frail and pre-frail adults tend to have a smaller social network and high levels of loneliness
Socially frail people have 66% higher prevalence rate for being disabled than their non-frail counterparts
Social isolation is OBJECTIVE. It’s defined as a limited social circle and the amount of relationships/nodes in your social circle and the frequency you interact with them is definable.
Social isolation increases ones risk of:
cardiovascular diseases
infection
cognitive impairments
mortality
This is likely because it increases inflammatory activity, as discovered by the increase in CRP and fibrogen. This is associated with the onset of frailty
psychosocial factors generally affect the body through 3 means:
immunity
metabolism
inflammatory capacity
The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) is incredibly receptive to social deficits and chronic social isolation, senses of threats, leads to increased anxiety, hostility, fragmented sleep, fatigue, vascular resistance and genetic alterations, decreased impulse control, depressive symptomatology, cognitive impairment, increased risk of dementia
People with low social risk profiles on average live 5.4 years longer than their high risk counterparts
An analysis found that older adults with adequate social networks or relationships were 50% more likely to survive than older adults with poor social problems or poor social relationships.
Having a spouse decreased the likelihood of mortality by 9-15%
The analyses authors suggest that quality relationships reduce stress and discourage self-destructive lifestyle habits. However, it may also be that people with strong social support may just come from developed backgrounds that alleviate geriatric health outcomes

Social vulnerability is a predictor of mortality and disability in Europe and Mediterranean countries, however, this effect was not discovered in Nordic countries
Poor social support is linked with lower survival rates in people with correctal cancer
Social isolation despite mortality; however, the predictors for men was not being married and not being affiliated with clubs or religious institutions and in women the predictors were infrequent social contact and reduced participation in religious activities
Living alone is associated with an increased risk of dying from death with unknown causes and murder
A Japanese study found that living alone on a remote Japanese islands increased men’s chances of frailty, but not in women
People from harsher social setting have higher rates of mortality from emergency visits to the hospital and for higher rates of readmissions
A weighted analysis found that social isolation had an average weighted effect on mortality of 1.29, loneliness 1.26, and living alone 1.32
Living alone has a higher mortality rate for men than for women
Also, this was true for widowed, divorced, and single folks
A Finnish study found a linear correlation between social isolation and mortality. He could not find such notable results from loneliness and mortality.
Poverty and social isolation may be linked
social isolation increases mortality in those who suffer from chronic illnesses involving proinflammatory mechanisms

Loneliness is often thought of as the psychological manifestation of social isolation, an instinctual reflection on the discrepancy between the social life and intimate connections they have and the one they need to feel satisfied

Solitary people are more sensitive to negative facial connections
people observed with functional magnetic resonance found that loneliness makes the visual cortex more responsive to negative social images
Loneliness is associated with high levels of cortisol and imparied immune activity, which leads to frailty
Loneliness leads to an increase in vascular resistance and fragmented sleep
loneliness was a major predictor of future frailty
People who lived alone and also felt lonely had longer rates of hospital stays and readmissions than their single living, but not lonely counterparts

Intervention in loneliness:
aging brings upon many changes:
retirement reduces ones social roles
widowing
emancipation of children
diminished health
dealing with death
All of these limit ones social network
There is little viable research on resolving loneliness in the elderly, and of the studies we have, few have control groups
The most effective interventions that we know of according to the research are GROUP INTERVENTIONS
support
educational activities
directed at specific groups
supported by existing community resources
training for facilitators
A meta analysis of intervention techniques classified 4 different types:
those that try to increase social skills
those that are aimed at social support
those that increase opportunities for social interaction
those that provide sociocognitive training
These studies often use different measurements to evaluate loneliness
UCLA and variations (UCLA, UCLA-R, UCLA-3)
Jong Gierveld scale
the convoy model of social relations
The Lubben Soicla Netowrk Scale
PANAS affect schedule
One study that compared the effectiveness of different intervention programs found
providing greater access to transportation for socialization, as well as opportunities for volunteer roles, like swim coach and bus driver had no impact on individual loneliness amongst the elderly
Programs that paired lonely, elderly people with socializing volunteers that would encourage participation in social activities had no impact
The third program had a professional coordinator train volunteers in offering social and leisure activities to them and also provided library services. This intervention had moderate impacts on their loneliness, which was the most the study found
meta analysis of 30 studies on loneliness relief:
9 out of 10 interventions were group interventions involving support or educational groups
6/8 of the ineffective interventions were one on one support, general advice, information, or advice regarding health needs
The conclusion: group support is effective, but home visits and befriending is ineffective
a systematic review of 12 e-interventions conducted between 2000-2017 found that although these studies claimed moderate effectiveness, the studies were not rigorous enough that they cannot be relied as consistent and strong
“We have not found, among the scientific literature, any work directed specifically at [senior citizen home residents].”
Conclusion:
future loneliness studies and interventions should
take into account cultural backgrounds
individual characteristics of participants
encourage active lifestyle
emphasize group interventions
empower the individual to recognize loneliness is natural and tolerable
encourage community networks of connection
